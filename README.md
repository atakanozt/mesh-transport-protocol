# Mesh Transport Protocol

Mesh Transport Protocol is a robust and efficient mesh transport protocol designed for reliable multicast communication. It leverages a sophisticated mesh network topology to ensure high resilience, low latency, and scalable distribution of data among a dynamically changing group of participants.

## Protocol Overview

The protocol is engineered to support complex group communication patterns and is particularly suited for applications requiring high reliability and consistency over distributed networks. Its design incorporates state-of-the-art algorithms for tree structure management, group topology optimization, and efficient data transmission strategies.

### Key Features

- **Reliable Multicast**: Ensures that messages are delivered to all group members with mechanisms for message recovery and ordering.
- **Dynamic Topology**: Adapts to changes in the network, allowing nodes to join and leave the group without disrupting communication.
- **Scalability**: Designed to efficiently operate in both small-scale and large-scale environments, from local networks to large distributed systems.
- **Extension Elements**: Supports a flexible extension mechanism to include additional information such as group topology, tree maintenance data, and participant metadata, enhancing the protocol's adaptability to specific use cases.
- **Efficient Bandwidth Usage**: Minimizes overhead and optimizes data transmission to reduce bandwidth consumption.
